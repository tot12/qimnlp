# QINetMNLP Text Generation: Detailed Explanation

## Overview
The text generation process in `generate1.py` uses a trained QINetMNLP model to generate text, character by character, based on a prompt. The process involves model loading, prompt encoding, iterative sampling, and decoding. Below is a detailed breakdown, including the equations involved.

---

## 1. Model Loading
- The model is loaded from a checkpoint, restoring its weights and configuration.
- The model is set to evaluation mode (`model.eval()`).

## 2. Prompt Encoding
- The prompt string is converted to a list of byte values (integers 0-255) using `ord(c)`.
- A special CLS token (256) is prepended to the sequence.
- The prompt is truncated if it exceeds the model's maximum sequence length.

## 3. Iterative Generation Loop
For each generation step (up to `max_new_tokens`):

### a. Model Forward Pass
- The current sequence tensor `x` is passed to the model:
  ```python
  out = model(x)
  lm_logits = out['lm_logits']
  ```
- `lm_logits` has shape `[batch, seq_len, vocab_size]`.
- The logits for the last token are selected:
  ```python
  logits = lm_logits[:, -1, :] / temperature
  ```

### b. Top-k and Top-p (Nucleus) Sampling
- **Top-k**: Only the `k` most likely tokens are considered. Others are set to `-inf`.
- **Top-p**: The smallest set of tokens whose cumulative probability exceeds `p` is kept.
- The probabilities are computed using the softmax function:
  $$ p_i = \frac{\exp(l_i)}{\sum_j \exp(l_j)} $$
  where $l_i$ is the logit for token $i$.
- Cumulative probabilities are used to filter tokens for top-p:
  $$ \text{cumulative}_i = \sum_{j=1}^i p_{(j)} $$
  where $p_{(j)}$ are sorted in descending order.

### c. Sampling the Next Token
- A token is sampled from the filtered probability distribution using multinomial sampling:
  ```python
  next_token = torch.multinomial(probs, num_samples=1)
  ```
- The sampled token is appended to the sequence.

### d. Decoding
- The sampled token is converted back to a character using `chr(token_val)`.
- The process repeats until a stopping condition is met (e.g., end of sentence, max tokens).

## 4. Output
- The generated characters are joined into a string and returned as the generated text.

## Key Equations
- **Softmax:**
  $$ p_i = \frac{\exp(l_i)}{\sum_j \exp(l_j)} $$
- **Top-p (Nucleus) Sampling:**
  $$ \text{Keep smallest set } S \text{ such that } \sum_{i \in S} p_i > p $$
- **Multinomial Sampling:**
  $$ \text{Sample } t \sim \text{Multinomial}(p_1, ..., p_n) $$
